	* The ConsoleBad need to welcome the user in the application and to read all the atributes from that person
	* That means that if i want to change how that user is welcome then i need to change the class
	* If i want to change how i validate the names that user provide then i need to change the class
	* If i want to change how i read the person details then i need to change the class
	* That is not SRP because i need to change the same class for the 3 reasons => 1)

1) A class should have just one responsability
	- A class should have just one reason to change
